# Minimaid Library for Stepmania

* Forked from: https://bin.jvnv.net/file/kI8Vr/mmmagic-dumpsterfire.zip
* See here for known licencing info: https://github.com/stepmania/stepmania/issues/1669

This was set up to provide a 64-bit mmmagic.dll, also can provide 32-bit

In theory the linux version would also build, CMake project has only been written for Windows

Feel free to raise issues, I'll fix if I can, I don't have a minimaid to test with myself

And if anyone knows the correct licencing / copyright please shout. For now marking it as MIT.

## Building

For Linux, you can use the ITGMania build Dockerfile to avoid installing dependencies: https://github.com/itgmania/itgmania/tree/release/Utils

```
mkdir build
cmake -B . ..
cd build
make
```
